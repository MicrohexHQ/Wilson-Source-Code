# Wilson Source Code 
This is a repository where I commit a cut down version of my discord bot. Feel free to clone this and use it to write your own! I have removed a lot of the features so you'll need to fill in the gaps yourself. I'd also recommend writing your own commands/ structure, though feel free to use this repo as a reference. Be sure to credit me [@RogueSensei](https://github.com/RogueSensei/) :smile:
## Wilson
Wilson is a Discord Bot using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API. His commands include general chat fun, moderation commands, sniffing out and shunning pings to himself or `@everyone` and generally being an ass.
### Inviting Wilson
Wilson can be invited to a server by typing `|invite` in a server he is in. He will then send a direct message to you with his invite link. A website is due to be constructed to invite him from there.
### Using Wilson
Wilson responds to specific commands with `|` as a prefix. For a list of all his commands, type `|help`. For details on a specific command, type `|help` followed by the name of a command listed when calling help.
Example: `|help hello`
## A Tip of the Hat
- [@AlexFlipnote](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote) - Structure based off of his [discord_bot.py](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/discord_bot.py) repo, and [nekos.py](https://github.com/Nekos-life/nekos.py) is used. Be sure to check out his work :smile:
- [Imgur/imgurpython](https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython) is also used
## Authoring your own bot
### Requirements
- `discord.py[voice]`
- `asyncio`
- `pyyaml`
- `bs4`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `youtube_dl`
- `rule34`

### Installing
If you haven't used github before, you can clone the repository by clicking the `Clone or download` button, or by using the git desktop command `$ git clone https://github.com/RogueSensei/Wilson-Source-Code.git`

Afterwards, `cd` to the project directory e.g. `$ cd C:\Documents\Wilson-Source-Code` and install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, you will need to install ffmpeg. On Windows, just download the `zip` folder, then locate to the `bin` folder within it, and put the `ffmpeg.exe` file in the root of the bot folder. On linux, just install it with your package manager, for example on debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
### Setting up
Open the file `config.py` in an IDE or text editor of your choice. The code should look like this:
```py
bot = {'owner': '',
       'client_id': '',
       'version': '',
       'prefix': '|',
       'pstart': 'python3 ./main.py',
       'game': '',
       'token': '',
       'invite_url': '',
       'update_name': '',
       'release_details': './data/misc/releaseplaceholder.txt',
       'checkin_details': './data/misc/checkin.txt',
       'checkin_channel': '',
       'update_details': './data/misc/update.txt',
       'startup_time': '',
       'pstart_time': '',
       'imgur_client_id': '',
       'imgur_client_secret': ''}
```
This is your configuration file for you bot. The items you should edit are as follows:
- `owner` - This is your Discord UserId
- `client_id` - This is your bots Discord UserId
- `version` - Version number
- `prefix` - Your bots prefix
- `pstart` - This is used for reboots. Change to `python ./main.py` if you are on Windows
- `game` - The "game" your bot is playing
- `token` - You bots token (Keep this a secret)
- `invite_url` - Url to invite your bot to a server
- `update_name` - Name of your most recent update
- `checkin_channel` - Channel your bot will message when booting up
- `imgur_client_id` and `imgur_client_secret` are API keys for `imgur`

Leave this items as they are (recommended for beginners):
- `release_details`
- `checkin_details`
- `update_details`

Don't touch these at all:
- `startup_time`
- `pstart_time`

### Running
Providing everything is set up correctly, run `main.py` and your bot should come online. Be sure to say `hello` :smile:
### Writing Help Files
You may have noticed in `/data/help` there are some text files named `all.txt` and `hello.txt`. This is the main help file and the help file for the `hello` command respectively. If you do not want to write your own help files, you can use the default `discord.py` help command which uses the comments at the top of each command method. To use the default help command, go to `main.py` and look for the line that reads `bot.remove_command('help')` on line 12 and comment it out. Then go to `generics.py` line 81. You should see the help command which should look something like this:
```py
@commands.command()
async def help(self, ctx, helpfile='all'):
    '''Help with commands'''
    try:
        data = helpers.open_file('./data/help/{}.txt'.format(helpfile.casefold()))
        embed = discord.Embed(title=None, description=data, colour=0x1f0000)
        await ctx.send(embed=embed)
    except:
        await ctx.send('An error has occured. The help file either doesn\'t nor will exist or hasn\'t been implemented yet.')
```
Comment this code out. *You can delete these lines if you wish, but I recommend leaving them in should you decide to write you own help files*
### Imgur API
If you want to make use of the Imgur API, you can register your bot [here](https://api.imgur.com/#registerapp). If you do not wish to use it, you can remove the `imgur_client_id` and `imgur_client_secret` entries in `config.py`. Then, inside `images.py`, comment out/remove:
- line 4: `import config`
- line 9: `from utils.imgurpython import ImgurClient`
- line 16: The `imgur` method:

```py
@commands.command()
async def imgur(self, ctx, *, search):
       '''Imgur'''
       client_id = config.bot['imgur_client_id']
       client_secret = config.bot['imgur_client_secret']
       client = ImgurClient(client_id, client_secret)
       search_result = client.gallery_search(search)
       if (len(search_result) == 0):
         await ctx.send('No results found')
         return
       galleries = list(map(lambda x : x.id, filter(lambda y : y.is_album, search_result)))
       album = client.get_album_images(galleries[random.randint(0, len(galleries) - 1)])
       images = list(map(lambda x : x.link, album))
       image = images[random.randint(0, len(images) - 1)]
       embed = discord.Embed(title='Imgur: {}'.format(search), description='',
                       colour=0x1f0000)
       embed.set_image(url=image)
       embed.set_footer(text='Requested by: {}'.format(ctx.message.author))
       await ctx.send(embed=embed)
```
You can also remove the `imgurpython` folder in `utils`
### All Set!
Now go fire up a raspberry pi and run your own discord bot!
